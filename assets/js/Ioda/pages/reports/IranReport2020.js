                                Internet connectivity in Iran has been known to suffer from disruptions, especially during times of
                                <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/iran-internet-down-outages-protests-plane-crash-websites-offline-flight-752-1481842?amp=1&amp;__twitter_impression=true">crises</a>
                                and
                                <a href="https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/">political upheavals</a>
                                . In this post, we use several complementary data sources to examine Internet connectivity in Iranian networks in a two-month period (February 17 to April 17 2020) covering events such as the legislative election (held on Feb 21 2020) and the early spread of COVID-19 cases in Iran. We analyze four Internet connectivity outages affecting Iranian networks during this time.

                                <p>
                                    a) Widespread Internet connectivity outages, affecting
                                    multiple networks simultaneously, continued to occur in Iran.
                                </p>
                                <ul className="bulleted-list">
                                    <li>
                                        On March 3 and March 11, we observed outages that affected many large Iranian networks, including cellular networks.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        These outages bore similarities to the
                                        <a href="https://ooni.org/post/2019-iran-internet-blackout/">
                                            widespread outages observed in Iran in November 2019
                                        </a>
                                        due to a government-mandated Internet connectivity shutdown: during all of these outages, many major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were affected, with some ISPs suffering a near-complete loss in connectivity. However, the causes of the outages on March 3 and 11 are unclear.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Unlike the November 2019 outages, the outages on March 3 and 11 affected non-state-owned Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to a much larger extent than state-owned ISPs.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Differently from the outages in November 2019 where ISPs observed outages that
                                        began several hours apart, the
                                        outages on March 3 and 11 affected several ISPs at nearly the same times. This
                                        simultaneity in outage start
                                        times could be the result of a single point of failure being affected.
                                        Alternatively, some mechanism
                                        (intentional or unintentional) that caused synchronized outages may have played
                                        a role.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    b) Isolated outages (non-widespread across ISPs) can
                                    significantly impact individual major ISPs but without large effects on other ISPs.
                                </p>
                                <ul className="bulleted-list">
                                    <li>On April 3, Information Technology Company (ITC, AS12880) experienced a
                                        90-minute Internet outage that affected
                                        a large share of its customers.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>On February 27, Shatel (AS31549) experienced a 30-minute Internet outage.</li>
                                    <li>During both these outages, other major providers did not seem to experience
                                        substantial drops in connectivity.

                                    c) The complementary views offered by multiple data sources
                                    increases outage detection accuracy and also allows us to uncover additional
                                    nuances.

                                    <li>The range of data sources we use includes Internet routing data (IODA’s BGP
                                        signal), active probing data (IODA’s
                                        active probing signal, ZeusPing signal), and data from end-user machines (IODA’s
                                        Darknet signal, CDN data
                                        signal). These sources provide lenses into different aspects of Internet
                                        connectivity.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Depending upon the nature of an outage and the networks it affects, the outage
                                        may be visible in some sources,
                                        but not others. For example, the outage affecting Shatel on February 27 was
                                        visible in the ZeusPing data source
                                        but not in other data sources.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>By combining inferences from multiple data sources, we are able to discover
                                        additional nuances. For example,
                                        during the outage affecting ITC on April 3, the CDN and Darknet signals show
                                        that there was a short-lived
                                        recovery from the outage that lasted a handful of minutes before connectivity
                                        dropped again to previous levels.
                                        Evidence of this recovery was not present in the other signals.
                                    </li>

                                    <strong>The ambiguity in assessing the extent of outages arises from the inherent
                                        challenges in detecting outages</strong>
                                    of various kinds: depending upon the nature of the
                                    outage and the networks affected, it may be apparent in some outage monitoring tools
                                    but not others. For example,
                                    even a widespread power outage that affects primarily end-users may not be visible
                                    in Internet routing data, since
                                    Internet routers are often in well-provisioned data-centers with backup power.
                                    However, such an outage may be
                                    visible in a data source containing measurements from user’s machines (such as
                                    IODA’s darknet data source).

                                    to investigate Internet connectivity in Iranian networks. We first describe IODA’s
                                    data sources. Next, we describe
                                    two novel and experimental data sources: (a) <strong>ZeusPing, a prototype

                                    In order to track and confirm Internet disruptions with greater confidence, IODA
                                    uses three complementary measurement and
                                    inference methods based on Internet routing (BGP) announcements, active probing, and

                                    (IBR) traffic. The routing announcements from BGP allow us to track reachability

                                    detect outages. Our implementation of Trinocular pings a few addresses at random
                                    from /24 blocks that are likely to
                                    respond to pings. We send pings to each block in 10-minute rounds. Using Bayesian
                                    inference, the system reasons
                                    about responses from blocks and detects outages when a /24 block’s responsiveness is

                                    To augment IODA’s existing Trinocular-based active-probing
                                    scheme, we launched ZeusPing, a novel fine-grained active-probing-based system under
                                    development at CAIDA. IODA’s
                                    existing Trinocular-based system detects outages at the /24 granularity and may not
                                    identify an outage if even a
                                    single address in a /24 block responds to probing. Thus, it potentially neglects
                                    outages affecting /24 blocks only
                                    partially, including larger outages affecting multiple /24 blocks. <strong>The
                                    ZeusPing system probes much more
                                    broadly than Trinocular and is therefore capable of detecting a superset of
                                    Trinocular outages, including those
                                    that affect </strong><em><strong>many</strong></em><strong> /24 blocks
                                    only </strong><em><strong>partially</strong></em>. Thus, ZeusPing complements IODA’s
                                    existing data sources
                                    and enables fine-grained analysis of outages that allows detailed characterization
                                    about the IP addresses
                                    affected by outages, their geographic-scope (which regions are affected), and the

                                    rounds” of measurement; every measured address receives a ping from 4 different
                                    vantage points in each round.

                                    tend to be ping-responsive during the day and fewer during the night. We can also
                                    observe some unusual peaks and
                                    drops: <strong>the drop on Mar 3 corresponds to an outage that we analyze in detail

                                    the peak on Mar 25 likely corresponds to network reconfiguration events.

                                        Among IODA’s data sources, the Darknet data source offers the
                                        best view into outages affecting end-users. However, it uses the count of IP
                                        addresses that are sending traffic from
                                        a network to measure “liveness”. This address-based view can distort the
                                        liveness signal in networks that use
                                        Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) since multiple users may be using the same IP address in
                                        such networks. Cellular networks
                                        often use CGN technology; consequently, the Darknet data source can sometimes
                                        lack visibility into cellular address
                                        space.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We collaborated with a large commercial CDN vendor
                                        to obtain a complementary “liveness” signal that may be able to capture end-user
                                        outages from cellular and
                                        non-cellular networks. We term this dataset the “CDN dataset”. <strong>This
                                        dataset consists of the total number of
                                        requests per minute from Iranian ASNs that were sent to the global CDN
                                        platform</strong>. The time series of the
                                        number of requests for each ASN was scaled by a value unique to that ASN, thus
                                        only preserving the “trends”, i.e.,
                                        fluctuations seen during the analysis period. Consequently, signals across ASNs
                                        cannot be compared for volume since
                                        they are scaled differently. However, for the purpose of determining if an ASN
                                        continues to have Internet
                                        connectivity, we are interested in the trend of its signal and not its volume.
                                        Thus, in the results that we present
                                        below, we further normalized these scaled values to fall between 0 and 1, to
                                        enable easy trend-comparison with
                                        signals from the other data sources.We expect that during an outage, users that
                                        lose connectivity will not be able
                                        to reach the CDN for fetching content. This should result in a drop in the
                                        number of requests seen from the
                                        network/ASN to the CDN. Thus, a drop in the number of requests signal from the
                                        CDN not only serves as ground truth
                                        for validating outages seen in other active or passive outage detection systems
                                        but also provides visibility into
                                        ASNs where existing tools might lack visibility (such as wireless providers).
                                        Additionally, like the darknet data,
                                        the CDN data is available at fine time-granularity—-once every minute for each
                                        ASN.

                                    <p>
                                        By using these complementary data sources, we obtain a more
                                        complete view of outages. This complementarity is a result of (a) the different
                                        network phenomena that each data
                                        source measures and (b) the different time-granularities of measurements.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>The data sources we used present lenses into
                                        different aspects of Internet connectivity.</strong> While the BGP data source
                                        measures Internet routing traffic
                                        and can therefore yield highly accurate outage inferences when there is a
                                        measured drop, outages do not always
                                        affect Internet routers (and consequently routing traffic) and can therefore be
                                        invisible in the BGP signal. Active
                                        probing has the potential to yield fine-grained outage data in networks which
                                        respond to active probes but several
                                        networks block probing traffic. While the Darknet and CDN data represent
                                        liveness traffic collected from
                                        user-machines, they can sometimes be erratic, leading to difficulties in
                                        accurately interpreting their signals for
                                        outage detection.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>The different time granularities
                                        of these data sources also results in more effective outage
                                        detection.</strong> The Darknet and CDN data sources
                                        have 1 minute time granularities, the BGP data source has 5-minute, and the
                                        active probing data sources (both IODA’s
                                        Trinocular-based system and ZeusPing) have 10 minute time granularities.
                                        Consequently, the active probing data
                                        sources may not be able to detect sub-10-minute outages but the Darknet and CDN
                                        Requests data may be able to detect
                                        such short-duration-outages as well.
